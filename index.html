            <h2>Education and Career</h2>
            <p>In 1977, James A. Gosling received his B.Sc degree in Computer Science from the
                University of Calgary.
                Then in 1983, James finally obtained a Ph.D majoring in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon
                University, with the dissertation title "The Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints".</p>
            <p>When he finished his doctoral program, he wrote a version of emacs (gosmacs). Before
                he decided to join
                Sun Microsystems, James built a multi-processor version of Unix while still in college. Seeing these
                interests and talents, one time a friend of his parents took James A. Gosling to the computer laboratory
                at the University of Calgary to develop his talents and interests, at that time he was only 14 years
                old.</p>
            <p>In 1984, James A. Gosling decided to join a small company that was just established at
                that time, namely
                Sun Microsystems. Initially James A. Gosling was involved in a development project called the Green
                Project, one of his works was a device called Star Seven, which was shaped like a PDA. Initially, the
                device was used as a home application sharing controller that could control television, answer the
                phone, and share other things. The tool can be used for various applications because it is based on a
                programming language that is not dependent on a particular processor. Along with the development of the
                name of the programming language which was originally called Oak, it was changed to Java until now.</p>
